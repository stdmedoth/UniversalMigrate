# UniversalMigrate

Have you ever needed a simple migration tool but only found large and complex software?
It happened to me, and that's why I built this simple tool, which can easily control how your software versions

you need just inform your server infos on file 'data/server.xml' and start your migrations

## migrate new 
> * Creates a new migration file template in data / migrations.

## migrate update 
> * Use the files on 'data/migrations' to update your database.

## migrate list 
> * List all migrations that was loaded on your server.

## migrate remove id_migrate 
> * Run downgrade and remove an migration.

## migrate reset 
> * Run downgrade and remove to all migrations 

### Create the migration template, edit the migration and downgrade files, then run migrate update to send it to database server.

## As i said. Its so simple!

###
Installation

### You need three dependencies

* `make` for the Makefile compilation
* `mysqlclient` for the mysql connector 
* `libxml` for the configuration reader
